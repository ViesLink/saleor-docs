## Overview

Adyen App is a payment integration app that allows merchants using the Saleor e-commerce platform to accept online payments from customers using Adyen as their payment processor. In addition to processing payments, the Saleor App Payment Adyen provides merchants with tools for managing refunds and chargebacks.

:::caution

To configure the Adyen App, you must have an account with [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com).

:::

The Adyen App allows for integrations with [Adyen Web Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow), [Adyen iOS Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/ios/drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow), [Adyen Android Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/android/drop-in), and [Adyen React Native Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/react-native/drop-in). It uses the [Adyen Drop-in Advanced Flow](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow).

:::info

Adyen App uses Adyen [Checkout API v70](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/CheckoutService/v70/overview) and [Management API v1](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/v1/overview).

:::

## Capabilities

The Adyen App implements the following [Saleor sync webhooks related to transactions](../../extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction):

- [`PAYMENT_GATEWAY_INITIALIZE_SESSION`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbpayment_gateway_initialize_sessionbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE_SESSION`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_initialize_sessionbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_PROCESS_SESSION`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum.mdx#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_process_sessionbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_CHARGE_REQUESTED`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_charge_requestedbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_CANCEL_REQUESTED`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_cancelation_requestedbcode)
- [`TRANSACTION_REFUND_REQUESTED`](../../../api-reference/webhooks/enums/webhook-event-type-sync-enum#code-style-fontweight-normal-webhookeventtypesyncenumbtransaction_refund_requestedbcode)

Furthermore, it's also prepared to handle [async Adyen webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks).

Adyen App follows the flow described in detail in the [Saleor Payment App documentation](../../payments#saleor-payment-app).

## Limitations

This section contains known limitations of this App.

### Maximum timeout for Adyen calls is 15 seconds

Saleor synchronous webhooks have a maximum response time limit of 20 seconds. The app restricts Adyen response time to 15 seconds to allow graceful error handling.
If Adyen surpasses this limit, the App will return a FAILURE status with an appropriate error message (Timeout Error).

### Maximum timeout for Saleor API calls is 5 seconds

The apps restricts Saleor API response time to 5 seconds for [`TransactionInitializeSession`](../../extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#initialize-transaction-session) and [`TransactionProcessSession`](../../extending/webhooks/synchronous-events/transaction#process-transaction-session) subscriptions. If Saleor API surpasses this limit, the App will gracefully continue processing.

If such timeout happens, the created [`TransactionItem`](../../../api-reference/payments/objects/transaction-item) will not have the metadata from Adyen on `additionalDetails` object, that include payment method type, credit card brand, etc.

## Configuration

For Adyen to appear as [available payment gateway](../../checkout/finalizing#listing-available-payment-gateways), you need to [install it in the Saleor Dashboard](../overview#usage). You must obtain the API key from Adyen and paste it into the Adyen App configuration form. Then, a wizard will guide you through the process of configuring the Adyen App, setting up the webhook to receive notifications from Adyen, generating the HMAC key, and adding allowed origins for the Client Key that's used on your Storefront.

### Configuring Adyen

Video introduction to Adyen configuration in Saleor:

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IhaDSml22Dc" />

You can install the Adyen app directly from your Saleor Dashboard. Go to the **Apps** section and click the **Install** button next to the Adyen app. Follow the instructions on the screen. After the installation is complete, select the Adyen app from the list of installed applications.

#### Creating new API Credentials

To create new Adyen API credentials head over to the Adyen dashboard, then **Developers -> API credentials**. Click **Create new credential** and choose **Web service user**.

In **Server settings -> Authentication** section generate new API key.

In **Client settings -> Authentication** section generate new client key.

Go back to the Adyen app configuration in the Saleor Dashboard. Provide a configuration name that you will be familiar with. In the **API Key** field provide the key from **Server settings -> Authentication** section. Select **TEST** environment.

:::caution
The configuration will not work until you save API credentials in the Adyen dashboard.
:::

Save API credentials in the Adyen dashboard, head over to the Adyen app configuration, and click **Save**. The rest of the form fields have been enabled.

In **Client key** field provide key from **Client settings -> Authentication** section. Select the merchant account you want to use from the dropdown.

#### Webook configuration

In Adyen dashboard head over to **Developers -> Webhooks**. Click the **+ Webhook** button and choose **Standard webhook**. Provide a description for the webhook.

In the **Server configuration** section provide URL the Saleor Adyen app has generated for you. You can copy it from the **Webhook URL** input in the Adyen configuration form. Leave default settings and click **Apply**.

In **Merchant accounts** select **Include only specific merchant accounts** and choose the merchant account you would like to use.

In **Events**, apart from events selected by default, select `EXPIRE`. Deselect `ORDER_CLOSED` and `ORDER_OPENED` events.

In **Additional settings -> Risk** select `Include the originalReference for CHARGEBACK_REVERSED events`.

In **Security -> Basic authentication** provide username and password. Apply changes. Use the same username and password in the **webhook username** and **webhook password** fields in the Adyen application.

Generate a new **HMAC key** in the **Security -> HMAC Key** section and copy it.

Apply the configuration details in the Saleor Adyen app then in Adyen dashboard save the new Adyen webhook.
Save the configuration. If everything went well, you should see a new button **Make test webhook call**. Use it to test if your configuration is correct.

:::caution

API Key provided inside the configuration must have the following permissions set in Adyen Dashboard:

- "Management API - Accounts read and write"
- "Management API - API credentials read and write"
- "Management API - Payment methods read"
- "Management API - Stores read and write"
- "Management API - Webhooks read and write"
- "Checkout encrypted cardholder data"
- "Merchant Recurring role"
- "Checkout webservice role"
- "Merchant PAL Webservice role"

:::

## Usage in Storefront or mobile apps

Adyen App can be used to integrate with Adyen APIs. By using a set of GraphQL mutations, one can interact with Adyen to authorize, capture, refund, and cancel payments.

import AdyenScreenshot from "./adyen-web-drop-in.png";

<img width={500} src={AdyenScreenshot} alt="Adyen Web Drop-in component" />

### Getting payment gateways

The first step is to fetch the Checkout object including [`availablePaymentGateways`](../../../api-reference/checkout/objects/checkout#code-style-fontweight-normal-checkoutbavailablepaymentgatewaysbcodepaymentgateway---) field. The `availablePaymentGateways` field contains a list of payment gateways available for given checkout. The Adyen App should be one of the payment gateways available in the list. Its `id` is [`app.saleor.adyen`](https://adyen.saleor.app/api/manifest) - defined in app's manifest.

```graphql
query {
  checkout(id: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6YWY3MDJkMGQtMzM0NC00NjMxLTlkNmEtMDk4Yzk1ODhlNmMy") {
    availablePaymentGateways {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "checkout": {
      "availablePaymentGateways": [
        {
          "id": "app.saleor.adyen",
          "name": "Adyen"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

`availablePaymentGateways` may contain other Payment Apps as well as [legacy Plugins](../../../developer/extending/payment-gateways) configured in the Dashboard. You should ignore the ones that you don't want to use for a specific checkout.

:::

### Obtaining Adyen payment methods

Next, you need to fetch configured payment methods from Adyen. To do that, use the [`paymentGatewayInitialize`](../../../api-reference/payments/mutations/payment-gateway-initialize) mutation. The mutation returns a `PaymentGatewayInitialize` object with `data` field containing a list of payment methods. The `data` field is an object with the following fields:

```ts
{
  paymentMethodsResponse: PaymentMethodsResponse;
  clientKey: string;
  environment: "LIVE" | "TEST";
  errors?: SyncWebhookAppErrors;
}
```

Where `PaymentMethodsResponse` is the result of calling Adyen's `/paymentMethods` endpoint and is described in the [Adyen documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/paymentMethods#responses-200). `SyncWebhookAppErrors` is [described below](#handling-errors).

If `errors` field doesn't exist or is an empty array, `paymentMethodsResponse`, `clientKey` and `environment` should be used to initialize [Adyen Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow).

```graphql
mutation {
  paymentGatewayInitialize(
    id: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6YWY3MDJkMGQtMzM0NC00NjMxLTlkNmEtMDk4Yzk1ODhlNmMy"
    amount: 54.24
    paymentGateways: [{ id: "app.saleor.adyen" }]
  ) {
    gatewayConfigs {
      id
      data
      errors {
        field
        message
        code
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

The response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "paymentGatewayInitialize": {
      "gatewayConfigs": [
        {
          "id": "app.saleor.adyen",
          "data": {
            "paymentMethodsResponse": {
              "paymentMethods": [
                {
                  "brands": ["visa", "mc"],
                  "name": "Credit Card",
                  "type": "scheme"
                }
              ]
            },
            "clientKey": "test_AHSJKADHK12731KDSALD11DSADASA003",
            "environment": "TEST"
          },
          "errors": []
        }
      ],
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

For instructions on how to add, remove or constraint payment methods from Adyen, please consult the [Adyen payment methods documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods).

:::

### Paying with Adyen

After a user has interacted with the Adyen Drop-in and entered payment details, [Drop-in event data along with other information](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/web-drop-in/additional-use-cases/advanced-flow#step-3-make-a-payment) should be passed to the [`transactionInitialize`](../../../api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-initialize) mutation as the `paymentGateway.data` field. The mutation returns the `TransactionInitialize` object with a `data` field containing the following fields:

```ts
{
  paymentResponse: PaymentResponse;
  errors?: SyncWebhookAppErrors;
}
```

Where `PaymentResponse` is the result of calling Adyen's `/payments` endpoint and is described in the [Adyen documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/payments#responses-200). `SyncWebhookAppErrors` is [described below](#handling-errors).

If the `errors` field doesn't exist or is an empty array, pass the `paymentResponse` to Adyen Drop-in. The Drop-in will handle the response and display the result to the user or require additional actions to proceed.

```graphql
mutation AdyenTransactionInitialize($data: JSON!) {
  transactionInitialize(
    id: "Q2hlY2tvdXQ6YWY3MDJkMGQtMzM0NC00NjMxLTlkNmEtMDk4Yzk1ODhlNmMy"
    action: AUTHORIZATION
    amount: 54.24
    paymentGateway: { id: "app.saleor.adyen", data: $data }
  ) {
    transactionEvent {
      pspReference
      amount {
        amount
        currency
      }
      type
    }
    data
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

Where `$data` is the object provided by Adyen Drop-in in the `onSubmit` (Web, React Native), `didSubmit` (iOS) or `makePaymentsCall` (Android) callback. Specifically, the following fields may be passed inside the `$data`:

- `paymentMethod` (required)
- `browserInfo` (required in browsers)
- `returnUrl` (required for some payment methods)
- `origin` (optional)
- `channel` (optional, `"Web"` by default)
- `order` (optional)

:::note

Moreover, Saleor Adyen App automatically provides the following fields to Adyen:

- `reference`
- `shopperReference`
- `additionalData.manualCapture (when action is authorization)`
- `merchantAccount`
- `countryCode`
- `shopperLocale`
- `amount`
- `authenticationData.threeDSRequestData.nativeThreeDS` (`"preferred"`)
- `metadata` (`{ transactionId, channelId, checkoutId, orderId }`)
- `lineItems`
- `shopperEmail`
- `shopperName`
- `telephoneNumber`
- `deliveryAddress`
- `billingAddress`
- `company.name`

:::

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "transactionInitialize": {
      "transactionEvent": {
        "pspReference": "XXXX9XXXXXXXXX99",
        "amount": {
          "amount": 54.24,
          "currency": "EUR"
        },
        "type": "AUTHORIZATION_SUCCESS"
      },
      "data": {
        "paymentResponse": {
          "additionalData": {
            "paymentMethod": "visa"
          },
          "amount": {
            "currency": "EUR",
            "value": 5424
          },
          "merchantReference": "SOME_MERCHANT_ID_",
          "paymentMethod": {
            "brand": "visa",
            "type": "scheme"
          },
          "pspReference": "XXXX9XXXXXXXXX99",
          "resultCode": "Authorised"
        }
      },
      "errors": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Performing additional actions (_optional_)

Optionally, additional actions may be required: authentication of payment with 3D Secure, scan of a QR code, or logging in to the bank to complete the payment. In this case, [`transactionProcess`](../../../api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-process) mutation should be used.

```graphql
mutation AdyenTransactionProcess($id: ID!, $data: JSON) {
  transactionProcess(id: $id, data: $data) {
    transaction {
      id
      actions
    }
    transactionEvent {
      message
      type
    }
    data
    errors {
      field
      code
      message
    }
  }
}
```

Where `$data` is the object provided by Adyen Drop-in in the `onAdditionalDetails` (Web, React Native), `didProvide` (iOS) or `makeDetailsCall` (Android) callback. The response is similar to the one from `transactionInitialize` but the `data` field has a different shape:

```ts
{
  paymentDetailsResponse: PaymentDetailsResponse
  errors?: SyncWebhookAppErrors;
}
```

`PaymentDetailsResponse` is the result of calling Adyen's `/payments/details` endpoint and is described in the [Adyen documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/Checkout/latest/post/payments/details#responses-200). `SyncWebhookAppErrors` is [described below](#handling-errors).

If the `errors` field doesn't exist or is an empty array, pass the `paymentDetailsResponse` back to Adyen Drop-in. The Drop-in will handle the response and display the result to the user or again require additional actions to proceed.

Repeat the step until the payment is successful or fails.

:::caution

Many payment methods are not settled synchronously. Sometimes it takes seconds, minutes, hours, or even days for a payment to go through. Adyen App will automatically handle Adyen webhook notifications and create transaction events in Saleor (see [`transactionEventReport`](../../../api-reference/payments/mutations/transaction-event-report)).

:::

### Apple Pay `onValidateMerchant`

To implement Apple Pay integration through Adyen and use your own Apple Pay certificate, you must implement `onValidateMerchant` (Web, React Native) or `onvalidatemerchant` (iOS). The Adyen Saleor App provides a way to validate the merchant using the `paymentGatewayInitialize` mutation:

```graphql
mutation PaymentGatewayInitialize($checkoutId: ID!, $data: JSON) {
  paymentGatewayInitialize(
    paymentGateways: [{ id: "app.saleor.adyen", data: $data }]
    id: $checkoutId
  ) {
    gatewayConfigs {
      id
      data
      errors {
        field
        message
        code
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

and provide the following JSON in `$data`:

```json
{
  "action": "APPLEPAY_onvalidatemerchant",
  "validationURL": "…",
  "domain": "…",
  "merchantIdentifier": "…",
  "merchantName": "…"
}
```

All the parameters should be provided according to [Apple Pay documentation on the Adyen website](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/apple-pay/web-drop-in?tab=_code_payments_code__2#page-introduction).

### Additional endpoints (optional)

To use some payment methods inside Adyen Drop-in you may have to implement the following callbacks:

- `onBalanceCheck` (Web, React Native), `checkBalance` (iOS) or `checkBalance` (Android)
- `onOrderRequest` (Web, React Native), `requestOrder` (iOS) or `createOrder` (Android)
- `onOrderCancel` (Web, React Native), `cancelOrder` (iOS) or `cancelOrder` (Android)

For example, these methods are required for [Gift card split-payments](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/gift-cards/web-drop-in?tab=config-payments_2#required-configuration).

:::note

Adyen's orders and requests for balance checks are not saved in Saleor. Each payment linked to Adyen's order will be stored as a separate transaction in Saleor.

Orders link transactions on the Adyen level. For example, if a user cancels an order (by removing gift card payment inside the Drop-in), every payment linked to that order will be refunded or voided.

:::

#### `onBalanceCheck`

To call the `/paymentMethods/balance` endpoint use the `paymentGatewayInitialize` mutation:

```graphql
mutation PaymentGatewayInitialize($checkoutId: ID!, $data: JSON) {
  paymentGatewayInitialize(
    paymentGateways: [{ id: "app.saleor.adyen", data: $data }]
    id: $checkoutId
  ) {
    gatewayConfigs {
      id
      data
      errors {
        field
        message
        code
      }
    }
    errors {
      field
      message
      code
    }
  }
}
```

and provide the following JSON in `$data`:

```json
{
  "action": "checkBalance",
  "paymentMethod": {
    "type": "giftcard",
    "brand": "givex",
    "encryptedCardNumber": "...",
    "encryptedSecurityCode": "..."
  }
}
```

The contents of the `paymentMethod` field come from the Adyen Drop-in.

Example `onBalanceCheck` implementation in TypeScript could look like this (depending on your GraphQL client):

```ts
async onBalanceCheck(resolve, reject, data) {
  const {
    paymentGatewayInitialize: { gatewayConfigs },
  } = await client.request(PaymentGatewayInitialize, {
    checkoutId,
    data: { action: "checkBalance", paymentMethod: data.paymentMethod },
  });
  const response = gatewayConfigs[0].data.giftCardBalanceResponse;
  resolve(response);
}
```

:::note

Error handling is intentionally omitted for brevity.

:::

The response received from Saleor with data from the Adyen app will be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "paymentGatewayInitialize": {
      "gatewayConfigs": [
        {
          "id": "app.saleor.adyen",
          "data": {
            "giftCardBalanceResponse": {
              "balance": {
                "currency": "EUR",
                "value": 5000
              },
              "pspReference": "BK4C…NN82",
              "resultCode": "NotEnoughBalance"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### `onOrderRequest`

Similarly to `onBalanceCheck`, to call the `/orders` endpoint use the `paymentGatewayInitialize` mutation and pass the following `$data`:

```json
{
  "action": "createOrder"
}
```

The `onOrderCreate` implementation in TypeScript could look like this (depending on your GraphQL client):

```ts
async onOrderCreate(resolve, reject, data) {
  const {
    paymentGatewayInitialize: { gatewayConfigs },
  } = await client.request(PaymentGatewayInitialize, {
    id: checkoutId,
    data: { action: "createOrder" },
  });
  const response = gatewayConfigs[0].data.orderCreateResponse;
  resolve(response);
}
```

The response received from Saleor with data from the `/orders` endpoint will be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "paymentGatewayInitialize": {
      "gatewayConfigs": [
        {
          "id": "app.saleor.adyen",
          "data": {
            "orderCreateResponse": {
              "amount": {
                "currency": "EUR",
                "value": 12000
              },
              "expiresAt": "2023-07-04T11:34:02Z",
              "orderData": "...",
              "pspReference": "W...82",
              "reference": "Checkout:Q2hlY2…jM1OGJm",
              "remainingAmount": {
                "currency": "EUR",
                "value": 12000
              },
              "resultCode": "Success"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once the order is created, you may complete the payment. Use the data received from the Drop-in inside the `onSubmit` method.
It includes the `order` property - Adyen App will charge the customer with the amount specified in the order's data.

For example: if you have only 20 EUR left on a gift card, and the order's total amount is 50 EUR, `order` data will firstly charge the gift card with the available amount (20 EUR) and the 2nd payment method with the outstanding order amount (50 - 20 = 30 EUR).

#### `onOrderCancel`

Should be called when the user removes a payment method in a pending Adyen order, for example when there was already a partial charge for a gift card but the user decided to use a different payment method.

To call the `/orders/cancel` endpoint, similarly to `onBalanceCheck`, use the `paymentGatewayInitialize` mutation and pass the following `$data`:

```json
{
  "action": "cancelOrder",
  "orderData": "..."
  "pspReference": "..."
}
```

The response from that mutation will be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "transactionProcess": {
      "data": {
        "orderCancelResponse": {
          "pspReference": "...",
          "resultCode": "Received"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `onOrderCancel` implementation in TypeScript could look like this (depending on your GraphQL client):

```ts
async onOrderCancel({order}) {
  const {
    paymentGatewayInitialize: { gatewayConfigs },
  } = await client.request(PaymentGatewayInitialize, {
    id: checkoutId,
    data: {
      action: "cancelOrder",
      pspReference: order.pspReference,
      orderData: order.orderData,
     },
  });
  const response = gatewayConfigs[0].data.orderCancelResponse;

  if (response.resultCode !== "Received") {
    throw new Error("Cannot cancel order");
  }

  checkout.update({order: undefined});
}
```

### Handling errors

The three mutations described above may return `data.errors` field. The existence of this field determines that the request was unsuccessful. `errors` is an array of `SyncWebhookAppError` objects. The `SyncWebhookAppError` object has the following fields:

```ts
{
  code?: string;
  message?: string;
  details?: JSONObject;

The `code` field is a string identifying the error. One of the following values is allowed:

- `UnknownError`
- `JsonSchemaError`

- `errorCode` – [Adyen error code](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/error-codes)
